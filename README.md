Introduction:
In today's digital society, platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp pose both threats and opportunities for minority languages like Frisian. Previous research highlights the potential of digital technologies to empower linguistic communities and revive endangered languages. However, the dominance of a few languages online and the informal nature of social media communication raise concerns. This study aims to investigate the usage of Frisian on Twitter and hypothesizes a decrease over time. By quantitatively analyzing the frequency of specific Frisian words, we provide empirical insights into the trends of the Frisian language in the digital age.

Related Work:
Previous studies have examined Frisian language use on social media platforms, particularly among teenagers. They highlight the informal nature of social media writing and the potential influence of these platforms on language choice. However, the frequency of Frisian language use over time has not been extensively explored.

Data and Analysis:
The RUG Twitter corpus, containing tweets from 2014 to 2021, was analyzed. The frequency of occurrence of Frisian words was examined using command-line arguments. The analysis revealed fluctuating trends in Frisian occurrence over the years, with a subsequent increase in recent years.

Conclusion:
The findings suggest a potential revival or increased utilization of Frisian on Twitter. This study contributes to our understanding of minority language preservation in the digital age. Further research can explore additional aspects of Frisian language use and investigate social factors influencing language choice on social media platforms.
