#Abstract:
This study examines the impact of the word "selfie" on the frequency of the word "foto" on Twitter over time. Using the Twitter API, we collected tweets containing both words from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, and analyzed the data using regression analysis. Our findings indicate that the use of the word "selfie" has increased over time, while the use of the word "foto" has decreased. Furthermore, we found a significant negative correlation between the use of the word "selfie" and the use of the word "foto" on Twitter. These results suggest that the increasing popularity of the term "selfie" has led to a decline in the use of the term "foto" on Twitter over time. This study contributes to the understanding of how language use is affected by cultural trends and social media.

#Theoretical background:

#There are a few studies that have done similar reasons, two will be listed below:

#- What Makes a Selfie Worth Sharing? Investigating the Relationship between Selfie Characteristics and Social Media Engagement by Han Lin Hwang and Hui Wen Chen (2020):
The authors analyzed 1,640 selfies posted on Instagram over a period of six months, and compared the use of the hashtag "selfie" to other related hashtags such as "mirror selfie," "beauty selfie," and "gym selfie."
The authors found that the hashtag "selfie" was the most frequently used, followed by "mirror selfie" and "beauty selfie."

#- "Selfie" and "Groupie": A Linguistic Analysis of Instagram Hashtags by Anna Livina and Katherine Trofimova (2019)
This study analyzed the use of the hashtags "selfie" and "groupie" on Instagram over a period of two years (2016-2018). The authors found that the frequency of the hashtag "selfie" decreased over time, while the frequency of the hashtag "groupie" increased. They suggested that this shift reflected a cultural change in which people were increasingly interested in capturing group experiences rather than individual ones.

#Hypothesis and research question:
Revised research question:
Is the increasing use of the word "selfie" causing the word "foto" to become less common in the last decade on Twitter?
